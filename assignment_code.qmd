Firstly, load necessary libray

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
install.packages("dplyr")

eruptions <- read.csv("eruptions.csv")
volcano <- read.csv("volcano.csv")
tree_rings <- read.csv("tree_rings.csv")
sulfur <- read.csv("sulfur.csv")


str(eruptions)
head(eruptions)


```



## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
